# Find.Me.Api

The Find Me Api provides users with address details which have geometry latitude and longitude that can be plot on the map.

This is a dot net core application showcasing clean architecture design, CQRS and Domain Driven Design.

An overkill for its use case, only built as an exercise.

Note: connection string is inlined which should never be.


# Getting started

:ok_hand: Please install Visual Studio 2019 Professional as a pre-requisite. Community edition is okay, but there could be some slight UI difference.

1. Clone the repo from ``https://github.com/pauljosephatay/find.me.api.git``
2. Right click on the solution file ``FindMe.sln`` and choose Open on the context menu. This should launch the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Run the application by clicking on the Run button on the actions bar.

**important:** The mongo db is protected and can only be connected from a list of IP Addresses.

4. To run tests, please go to menu bar and choose Test > Run All Tests.
